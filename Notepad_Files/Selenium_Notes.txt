Software Testing: It is a process to evaluate the functionality of a software application with an intent to find whether the developed software met the specified requirement or not and to identify the defects or bugs to ensure that the product is defect-free in order to produce a quality product.

Significance of Software Testing:
1. Cost-effectiveness: if the bugs can be identified in the early stages of development then it costs much less to fix them when comparing the later stages of development.
2. Customer satisfaction: improves the user experience of an application and gives the satisfaction to the customer.

4. Product Quality: helps in strengthening the market reputation of a company by delivering a quality product.
