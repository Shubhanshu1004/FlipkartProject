Page Object Model:
1. It is also known as POM.
2. It is a design pattern or approach to create a object repository for storing all the web elements.
3. It is useful in reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance.
4. In POM, consider each web page of an application as a class file. Each class file will contain only corresponding web page elements. Using these elements, 
   testers can perform operations on the website under test.

Advantages of Page Object Model:
1. Helps with easy maintenance: If a drop-down menu is changed to a radio button, POM helps to identify the page to be modified and this identification is necessary 
   to make the required changes in the right files.
2. Helps with reusing code: Byusing POM, one can write the test code for one page and reuse it for another test code.
3. Readability and reliability of scripts: 


Data Driven Framework:
It is an automation testing framework in which we read data from data files and stored into variables in test scripts. In this framewok we keep test cases seperate from the test data.
